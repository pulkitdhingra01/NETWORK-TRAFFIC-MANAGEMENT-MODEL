# NETWORK-TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT-MODEL

In this project, firstly I analysed the Netflow record logs for the time period of one month from the server then I applied the Data Visualisation to obtain certain patterns from the Dataset. To avoid redundancy and better analysis I classified the data as DNS Request and DNS Response. Secondly, after applying the machine learning models, I compared the individual performance between K Nearest Neighbors(KNN) and Naive Bayes(NB) machine learning classifiers to show any of the classifier performs better.
